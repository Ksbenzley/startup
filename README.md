# Jammix

[My Notes](notes.md)

A music social media site in which users can combine their music or add onto anothers. They can then share this music on the site and let it be discoverable by others.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Jammix will be an online site in which users can upload audio files of their instrument playing. Other users can then also upload their audiofiles, in a comment section type area, playing over the original upload from the root user. Then, the root user can choose to recognize another user's audio file as an official one, combining the two. For example, someone can upload an audiofile of a baseline. Then, two other users will "comment" their audiofiles of their drum lines. The bassist can then choose one of the drum lines to be the "official". Of course, you can still listen to all the uploads.

### Design

![Design image](jammix.png)

The design I'm working on will hopefully combine both audio and images to make it visually appealing. There could be a lot going on so its important to keep the User Interface as neat and uncomplicated as possible.

    actor User
    User ->>Website: upload audio file
    Website->>Website: combining audiofiles
    Website->>User: complete audio file
    Website->>You: complete audio file
```

### Key features

- Uploading audio files
- Mixing audio files; or combining them at the very least
- Comment section of audio files; all public

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structural and organizational elements
- **CSS** - design, animating, UI
- **React** - login page, audio upload
- **Service** - login, API usage
- **DB/Login** - User files, info
- **WebSocket** - a new post is created by a user

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable, I learned a lot about how servers work, especially Amazon AWS servers. I learned what an elastic IP is and how they are used. I also learned about security keys and server sizes. However, there was a lot of options on the Amazon AWS page, so there is definitely more for me to learn in the future. Also, here is the command to ssh into the server from my local device: 
-  ssh -i [path to security key] ubuntu@3.88.140.178

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://jammix.click).
