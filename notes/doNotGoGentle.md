Do not go gentle into that good night,
old age should burn and rave at close of day.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men know that dark is right,
because their words had forked no lightning, they
do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
their frail deeds may have danced on a green bay.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
