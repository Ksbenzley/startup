# Jammix

[My Notes](notes.md)

A music social media site in which users can combine their music or add onto anothers. They can then share this music on the site and let it be discoverable by others.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Jammix will be an online site in which users can upload audio files of their instrument playing. Other users can then also upload their audiofiles, in a comment section type area, playing over the original upload from the root user. Then, the root user can choose to recognize another user's audio file as an official one, combining the two. For example, someone can upload an audiofile of a baseline. Then, two other users will "comment" their audiofiles of their drum lines. The bassist can then choose one of the drum lines to be the "official". Of course, you can still listen to all the uploads.
